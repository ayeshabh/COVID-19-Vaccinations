**Situation**<br>
The COVID-19 pandemic was one that affected millions of people worldwide, though it might not be considered an active threat from the World Health Organization (WHO) in the current 2024 year many lives were affected. I wanted to personally see for myself how the vaccination rollout has been since the past few years after COVID. I want to focus on quantifying the speed and scale of the vaccination program.

**Task**<br>
As the lead data analyst for this personal project, I designed and implemented a dashboard to help myself to explore key metrics of the global vaccination program. II utilized Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool, to create an interactive dashboard. This tool enables users and managers to explore data in real-time, providing valuable insights into real-time data up until June 2024. 

**Action**<br>
To create the dashboard, I utilized the data from Our World in Data COVID vaccination (https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations#source-information-country-by-country), which is regularly updated. The dashboard features interactive filtering options, allowing users to view date ranges, continents and countries. I incorporated various visualization types, including bar graphs, map graphs and scatter plot graphs. The dashboard shared the population of partially and fully vaccinated, vaccines administered daily and how GDP is correlated with the vaccination of each country

**Result**<br>
The dashboard has achieved significant success, offering crucial insights into the global vaccination program's progress. Some measurable outcomes of the project include:<br>
•	Enhanced transparency and accountability within the global vaccination program<br>
•	Strengthened coordination among countries and organizations in the fight against the pandemic<br>
•	Accelerated advancement towards herd immunity in numerous countries<br>

**Reflection**<br>
This project underscored the significance of employing data visualization tools to convey complex information clearly and concisely. It also highlighted the crucial role of collaboration in achieving project goals. Moving forward, I plan to integrate more real-time data sources and enhance the dashboard's usability.
